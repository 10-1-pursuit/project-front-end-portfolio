# Front-end Portfolio Project

This project is designed to test all of the skills you've learned so far. By the end of this project, you should have a portfolio-ready project you can share on your resume as well as with potential employers.

This project will:

- Have a deployed front-end application.
- Allow for user interaction through button clicks and form inputs.
- Make requests to an external API.
- Have a theme and unique product design.

## Project scoring

This project has four different parts on which you will be graded. Each part is weighted differently.

- 50% of the project is scored on **completion**.
- 20% of the project is scored through the **mastery rubric**.
- 10% of the project is scored through **stretch goals**.
- 20% of the project is scored through the **presentation rubric**.

In total, you must receive at least 70% to complete this project. For example, you could attain 40% of points through the completion requirements, 15% of points through the mastery rubric, 10% of points through the presentation rubric, and 5% of points through the stretch goals.

### Completion

Several specific requirements should be completed as part of this project. Read each of the tasks and features below carefully to ensure you understand what is being asked of you. If you complete the task or feature in full, you will receive full credit. If the task or feature is partially complete, you will receive partial credit.

#### Overall requirements

1. Create a GitHub repository and upload your code to it.
1. Your GitHub repository should have a `readme.md` file with setup instructions for your application.
1. Your project should have a coherent theme and narrative.
1. Your project should be deployed to the web. Include a URL to your deployed website in the `readme.md` file.

#### Front-end visual requirements

5. Your application must have at least two `.html` files that are connected.
1. Your application must include one or more `.css` files that are linked to one or more pages.
1. Your application must include one or more `.js` files that are linked to one or more pages.
1. You must make use of CSS Grid to organize your content on at least one of your pages.
1. You must use the `:hover` selector in at least one CSS rule.
1. You must use an HTML form on at least one of your pages.
1. All of your pages must have some visual changes that occur when the screen is a different size.

#### Front-end interactivity requirements

12. On page load, an external API request must be made. Upon receiving a successful response, something visual on the page should change.
1. When a form is submitted on your page, JavaScript should prevent the default behavior of that form and some other effect should take place.
1. There should be at least one way to incorrectly submit the form. When the form is incorrectly submitted, an error message should be added to the DOM for the user.
1. Based on a button click or form submission, an external API request must be made. Upon receiving a successful response, something visual on the page should change.

### Mastery rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your increasing skill at writing good code and following best practices. To view components of the mastery rubric, view the appropriate assignment on Canvas.

### Stretch goals

This section of the project measures your ability to go above and beyond in creating your project. To score points in this section, you should incorporate a feature, technology, or skill not explicitly required by the project instructions.

When you submit your pull request, _make sure to include a description of any stretch goals you implemented._ You may choose from the list below or come up with features or tasks that are more relevant to your specific implementation of the project.

- Add a button or icon to the error that displays when a form is incorrectly filled out. When this button or icon is clicked, the error is removed from the page.
- Use [CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) to add effects to your page.
- Store some information locally through [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). This information should affect what is shown on the page when the page is reloaded.
- Use a CSS framework such as [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- Split your CSS or JavaScript into multiple files, with each file relating to a specific functionality. For example, create a new file called `api.js` that includes the JavaScript code that makes requests to your external API.

Points will be allocated in this section at the discretion of the instructor.

### Presentation rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your ability to present your project and your code. These skills are crucial for succeeding in the course and getting your first job as a software developer. To view components of the mastery rubric, view the appropriate assignment on Canvas.

## External APIs

Your instructors will give you access to a Pursuit-hosted API that contains a variety of data. You can build your application using any one of these data sets if you so choose.

In addition to the Pursuit-hosted API, you may wish to choose from some of the following APIs. These APIs may require API keys. Before committing to working with one of the following APIs, _ensure that you can get access to the data from it via a request from a front-end application._ It _is not recommended_ that you pay for an API for this project.

1. [Star Wars](https://swapi.dev/)
1. [Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
1. [News](https://newsapi.org/)
1. [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/)
1. [Pokemon](http://pokeapi.co/)
1. [Card Deck](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)
1. [Google Books](https://developers.google.com/books/)
1. [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
1. [Chuck Norris](http://www.icndb.com/)
1. [Rick and Morty](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest)

The following two websites provide access to a number of APIs. Not all of these APIs are easy to access and some will be paid. Please be careful before engaging with an unknown API.

1. [GitHub: Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
1. [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/)

## Project setup

_Do not_ fork this repository. Instead, create your repository on GitHub and submit the URL directly to Canvas.

Then, follow the specifications above to create your application. Work with your instructors to approve your features before you begin working on them.
